For the first time in Hackney Central an all abilities and all standards table tennis drop in session has been introduced. 

On Tuesday 14 September 2021, we kicked off in style in front of a full house an all inclusive ‘just turn up’ table tennis drop in session at Hackneys Central KingsHall Leisure Centre. The plan is to continue to hold these sessions every Tuesdays from 6-8pm and as we grow break it into two sessions to allow for junior sessions to start early.

Basic Bats and balls will be provided if needed, and the cost is comparative to costs in other centres within the borough.

Kids, GLL members; Unwaged and OAP’s get a discounted rate otherwise it’s a cheap £4:90 to play for approx 2 fun hours where coaching is available. 

Sessions are coached and superbised to ensure safety and satisfaction of customers.

For further information please contact the centre or call/text: 07378840390 or email: chris.beckley.tt@gmail.com

May the nets and edges be with you when you visit 😀🏓💐
