**Aftet a very long 18 months or so of zero table tennis action at our beloved home of clissold leisure centre, Friday 3rd of September will go down in the annals of the club history as a golden moment when all that seemed lost was fully restored,  Long queues marked our return from 7pm🏓 with all hands on deck to set up.**

**Hopefully bookings to play table tennis with friends and families will also return and bookable via the Better App in the very near future** 

**And again we look forward in October the return of the …Yes, you guessed it The Central London League (Home&Away) Tournaments - And Yes, Clissold being the most successful team of 2019/20 season will return with approx 6 teams with one team in every division.**

**To take part in the league tournaments please register your interest by text or phone below:**

**Thank you to all those who made our return a memorable one.**

**See you next and every Friday from 7pm for an Open All Inclusive Community Table Tennis Drop In Session At Clissold Leisure Centre, London N16 9EX🏓🏓🏓🏓🏓🏓🏓🏓🏓**
